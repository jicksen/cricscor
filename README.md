# Simple Cricket Score Tracker

This is a basic cricket score tracker application built using Kivy, a Python framework for cross-platform application development.

## Features

- **Input fields:** Enter batting team, bowling team, and overs.
- **Separate scorecards:** Displays runs, wickets, overs, and balls for both teams.
- **Scoring buttons:**
    - Add runs (1, 4, and 6)
    - Add wickets
    - Add extras (wide, no-ball, bye, leg bye)
    - Dot ball

## How to Run

1. **Install Kivy:**
   ```bash
      pip install kivy
      Save the code: Save the provided code as a Python file (e.g., cricket_scorer.py).
      Run the app:
      Bash
      python cricket_scorer.py```

## To Do
- **Innings change:** Implement a way to switch between batting teams (e.g., a button or automatic switch after a set number of overs).
